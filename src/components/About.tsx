              <p>Origin, the first dApp running on the Energy Web, unlocks the beginning of a new era for the world’s renewable energy and carbon markets.<br />
                 It records the provenance and automatically tracks the ownership of renewably generated electricity<br />
                with unprecedented transparency, integrity, and detail—including location, time, source type, and CO2 emissions</p>

              <p>The result: lower costs and more enhanced transparency for transactions, <br />
               greater market access for buyers and generators of all sizes, and new services built with Origin that run on the Energy Web.</p>

              <p>Renewable energy generators and buyers can work with EWF over the course of 2018<br />
               to run their own market demos showcasing how the Origin dApp works and providing input to ensure it meets business needs.</p>
